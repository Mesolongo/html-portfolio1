<h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I am a lover of many things. I am mainly a lover of learning. I believe I am a lifelong learner.
Apart from that, I like writing a lot. I am still learning how to master this craft but I am enjoying the journey toward that bigger goal.
I like working in teams with people who challenge me to become the best version of myself. I like to listen a lot to what people have to say because I believe that everyone can teach me something I do not already know.
I like also teaching people. There is a certain joy in teaching that I cannot explain. When you see the satisfaction from someone's face when you explain to him what he could not figure; there is pure happiness in that.
There is more to me than what I have just described but this is some of the things that define me.
